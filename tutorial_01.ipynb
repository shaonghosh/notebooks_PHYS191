    "\n",
    "#### This tutorial is first of a series of tutorials notebooks for students who do not have any prior Python experience. The tutorials should not be considered an exhaustive text or replacement of any books on Python in any way. It is simply a playground notebook that allows you to quickly refer to some of the most commonly used functionalities. Because it is in a notebook format, you can get your hands-dirty and try tweaking the lines of codes themselves. This will hopefully make the learning experience more enjoyable. Do not worry about breaking anything. Since, you will either be running this one a remote machine one a \"copy\" of this notebook, or you will be cloning the source from the repo using git, you can not break anything even if you want to. You might break your own version, but you can always restart the remote instance of the code, or if you have cloned the repo, just simply re-clone it, and everything will be back to working state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this notebook we will be working on the following: \n",
    "#### (1) First we will learn about the different data-type in python.\n",
    "#### (2) Then we will learn about the basic operations that can be performed on these data-types\n",
    "#### (3) We will learn about Boolean data-type and Boolean operation.\n",
    "#### (4) This will then lead us to comparison operators\n",
    "#### (5) Finally, we will then learn about mixed data-types like Lists and Tuples."
